# GroceryStore
No Queue ! No waiting ! Get Things done
We propose an e-commerce website.
A site where people can add things (like groceries) to cart from the desired shop, and can just go and pick it up from the shop.
So,  there will be no waiting time, no billing time and can prevent crowding in the shops.
      This system will not only be used in pandemic situations, but also in the post- pandemic period where, preventing the further waves are crucial.
          The website includes the network of major supermarkets and their product details. So that customers can compare the prices and buy. It also helps in a healthy market competition.
Since it is not based on home delivery, delivery charges can be saved.
This system will surely helps to control the impact of covid 19.
